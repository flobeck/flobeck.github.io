Hi, I'm Flo.

Currently I am working towards my Phd in computer science at the Vision & Fusion Lab of KIT.
Before that I studied {cognitive, computer} science in {Tübingen, Göttingen, Karlsruhe}.

<br> <br>

Things I like:
* computer science (theory of computation, algorithms, ML)
* mathematics (numerical analysis, probability theory)
* literature ([DonDeLillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_DeLillo), [Arno Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt)) 
* coffee
